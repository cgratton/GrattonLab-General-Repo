README - FCPROCESS_GrattonLab

First, you'll need to set up a datalist. See EXAMPLE_DATALIST.xlsx for an example

Then, to run:
- open terminal on Quest
- in terminal, type:
> srun --x11 --account=b1081 --partition=b1081 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --mem=60G --time=4:00:00 --pty bash -l
# see additional details below. Note that > 20 GB is needed for rest runs
- then type:
> module load matlab
> matlab -singleCompThread
- In matlab window,run a startup script that links to other relevant files (load_untouch_nii) in the CIFTI resources folder before starting. 
See my /home/cgv5452/startup.m for example
> startup
- Then navigate to your github repo location and run make_fs_masks and FCPROCESS script. Examples:
> make_fs_masks('INET003','/projects/b1081/iNetworks/Nifti/derivatives/preproc_fmriprep-20.2.0')
> FCPROCESS_GrattonLab('EXAMPLESUB_DATALIST.xlsx','/projects/b1081/iNetworks/Nifti/derivatives/preproc_FCProc/','defaults2');


------
If you're having crashing issues with MATLAB, try the commands below before starting to make sure it's not a memory issue with loading nifti files:
> cd /home/cgv5452/
> startup % this script sets up needed paths
> aa = load_nii('/projects/b1081/iNetworks/Nifti/derivatives/preproc_fmriprep-20.0.1/fmriprep/sub-INET003/ses-1/func/sub-INET003_ses-1_task-rest_run-01_space-MNI152NLin6Asym_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz');


So far -
matlab works, but files don't load: quser23
fails on: quser24
works consistently with srun command above

Instructions from Alper for starting an interactive session with more memory:
srun --x11 --account=b1081 --partition=b1081 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --mem=20G --time=4:00:00 --pty bash -l
 
This command submits an interactive job to b1081 allocation's compute nodes. The job reserves 1 core (--ntasks-per-node flag) from 1 node (-N flag) and 20 Gigabytes memory (--mem flag) for 4 hours (--time flag). The last flag "--pty bash -l" (the last letter is lowercase L) is for opening a bash terminal on the compute node of b1081 so you can work on the resources defined above interactively. You can adjust the time and memory (up to 120G for the current nodes) depending on your analysis time and data size.
